> A comprehensive guide to becoming a self-taught backend software developer.
> Guide is presented in the form of a short to-do list.

### Intro

This is a step-by-step guide for becoming a self-taught backend software developer with no/little previous experience in the field.
It covers various topics ranging from the basics of the Internet to the programming languages required.
I intend to continuously update the guide as I venture out into the world of software development.
Inspired by the [Step by step guide to becoming a modern backend developer in 2021](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
